## Description
Project focused on analyzing a dataset of song lyrics and trying to idenfity their respective music genres. This involved utilizing essential techniques, algorithms, and models used in Natural Language Processing, as well as understanding the architectures of typical text analytics applications and libraries for building them.
Throughout the Text Analytics course, we gained expertise in designing, implementing, and evaluating applications that exploit analysis, interpretation, and transformation of texts. We developed a strong background in NPL and machine learning, including linguistic essentials such as words, lemmas, morphology, Part of Speech (PoS), and syntax.
We also learned and utilized various tools and libraries, including NLTK, Spacy, Keras, and pytorch.
